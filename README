Sinatra + Thin + streaming + dotCloud
=====================================

To test locally:

- gem install bundler
- bundle install
- thin -p 4567 start
- for N in `seq 1 10` ; do curl http://localhost:4567/subscribe & done
- curl http://localhost:4567/publish

You should see 10 messages looking like this:

  hello #<Sinatra::Helpers::Stream:0x00000001dc9618

And one like this:

  published to 700 stream(s).


To test on dotCloud
===================

- dotcloud create -f sandbox thin
- dotcloud push thin

The base URL will be show at the end of the push. You can then run the same
test as shown above, by changing the URLs.


Thanks
======

I'd like to thank Thibaut Barrère and Sébastien Gruhier, for giving a basic
streaming example with Thin+Sinatra.
